# Reversi-Game-with-Computer-Opponent

C++/OpenGL program calculates the number of flips
a blue piece can make with every possible position 
a blue can be placed and then choses a position that 
will result in the most flips from red to blue. 

*This started as an assigment, we were given some starter code.

Other Contributors: Donald House, Michael Ringham, Anantha Natarajan.
(They were all instructors/TAs for the class I was given the assignment in.)

I created the computersTurn() function that was the decision making part
of the code for blue's turn. I also created the option for the user to 
play the computer or to have a two player version. Lastly,
I created a function to print out the score and winner of the game.

Anantha helped implement the glutTimerFunc that made the blue
piece wait before appearing after the red had its turn.
